Privacy options should in my humble opinion should be opt out rather than opt in to destroy the narrative that opting in or using such tools such as coinjoin are illegal/wrong. This puts users off or they do not even think about it. It protects the network further. We cannot ask for permission and leaving a default state of non or less private is worse. Every wallet should be at least focused on payjoin addition like btcpayserver/bluewallet. Things will get worse and the moves are there to strangle the edges of bitcoin via on ramps. It is easy to stop or slow privacy damage and the companies that operate around these areas whilst they are new then dismantling a whole system of privacy damage that ends up being fully in place. Their efforts must be treated as attack, bitcoin is antifragile, let us show them once again just how much so it is.  Thank you again for all you do."

For example, it was incredibly slow when storing data on an HDD but quite fast when stored on an SSD, however I didn't have enough space for the blockchain on my SSD, so I had to pull some tricks to get bitcoin to store the blockchain on the HDD but store the database on the SSD. These kinds of things should be done automatically or at very least made much easier for users. Were I to run a node again, I would probably run a pruned node.   I also don't transact with bitcoin often, so running a node for me isn't as useful. Were I to run a node again, I would put in the effort to make it a public node, however again this should be made simpler for end users.

Now, I run a bitcoin core node on a raspberry pi and am very satisfied to know that I have a full archival node. I use this node for various lightning-related activities. I would like to also use it as the node for my hardware wallet but am not familiar enough with the wallet features of bitcoin core to properly get that connected.

Because estimation often doesn't really consider the velocity at which the mempool is rising, so even a large fee can sometimes not clear for many hours, at which time, it's much better to just wait rather than overpay if it's not a crucial transation.  Overall though Bitcoin Core seems to be doing great.  I heard that the wallet may become a separate project from the core, which might be a good idea because then people who don't use the wallet or who don't need the wallet features can choose to upgrade Bitcoin Core only maybe saving some time spent in upgrade cycles."

To stay competitive, it has to evolve. Although immaterial, it would be nice to see most of things one would configure in the command line interface appear as configuration settings in the GUI. The GUI is pretty light-weight compared to the range of possible settings. I'd also like to see more graphics, literal graphs that give me insights into all kinds of performance metrics. Don't be afraid to aggregate performance benchmarks somewhere in the network. They don't have to be stored in the blockchain. They can be parasitic over the same P2P connection and relayed by peers to larger nodes, even centralized nodes, that aggregate and report performance metrics.

The programming is so elegant and the math is so beautiful.  It's led me to researching interesting core functions such as, in mining, how the double SHA256 hashing algorithm works with the changing nonce in the blockheader, with difficulty factored in, which my ASIC tries relentlessly to find a hash that is less than the target (are we still at 17 leading zeros?) .  I started with Bitcoin in 2013 and recently found my encrypted Schildbach Android Bitcoin wallet backup file.  I was able to decrypt it with openssl on a Raspberry Pi and access my private key that had .01BTC in it (yay!).  It's little wins like this, with my ever improving technical knowledge with the Bitcoin algorithms, and substantial fiat investment over time that have led me to think about long term cold storage, scalability, wrapped EC20 BTC, and ever increasing network fees.  I have a full node to support our network and contribute back to the Bitcoin community, and I am interested in creating a SegWit/ Lightning Network node to help address scalability of Bitcoin.

Most people buy BTC from Coinbase and it would be nice to get it to private cold storage without all the inputs and sat/byte fees.  I will eventually send new BTC to Core for long-term storage.","While I am new at it, I like the command line interface.  I can solo mine without a pool.  Running core supports the network.
